# Description
A collection of tweaks for the Outlying Destiny modpack.<br/>
<br/>
Outlying Core features mods' tweaks and fixes for the pack, while trying to keep most things easily editable thanks to the use of resourcepacks.<br/>
You are free to use it at your own risk.

# Changes:
 - Ender IO:
    - Changes the machines' energy usage from quadratic to linear so that machines' speed can be gated more precisely during progression (e.g. recipes' energy cost can be set in a way that machines with lower tier capacitors aren't terribly slow and with higher tier capacitors aren't incredibly fast)
    - Changes the Octadic Capacitor base modifier value from 3 to 3.5
 - Iron Jetpacks:
    - Removes the need of using tints to get different Jetpacks' models colors by injecting a different texture for each tier (path for textures: "ironjetpacks/textures/models/armor/jetpack_id.png")
